Etizolam is the most abused drug of the benzodiazepine class. The treatment of benzodiazepine dependence is difficult. We report a case of successful dosage reduction in a 24-year-old female patient with etizolam dependence. She was diagnosed with etizolam dependence at the age of 22 years old. We proposed a benzodiazepine dependence treatment that involved replacing etizolam with a long-acting benzodiazepine class drug in conjunction with a long-term weaning plan. However, the patient refused the treatment and insisted that reducing the number of tablets would increase her anxiety. After providing a detailed explanation and receiving consent from the patient, a treatment regimen consisting of fine granules of etizolam mixed with lactose granules was begun with the aim of reducing the percentage of etizolam at a rate of 0.3 mg/week. The treatment of etizolam dependence in this patient was successful. This treatment strategy may be an effective option for patients who are difficult to treat with conventional methods, or who have anxiety regarding the reduction of the amount of the drug itself. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25187742 [PubMed]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

We experienced an unusual case of poisoning wherein the result of Triage DOA immunoassay screening was negative, although Depas (etizolam) was detected in the blood of the victim who had been suspected to prescribe Depas by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Depas has been widely used for the treatment of anxiety in Japan. Three immunoassay screening devices (AccuSign BZO, Monitect-3, and Fastect II) were evaluated for their specificity for etizolam, its 2 major metabolites M-III and M-VI, and other metabolites of benzodiazepines in urine. With AccuSign BZO, etizolam, M-III, and M-VI could be detected at concentrations of 1,000 ng/mL in urine; however, they could not be detected even at concentrations of 25,000 ng/mL with the other kits. In the case of etizolam poisoning, the result of AccuSign BZO was positive; however, Triage DOA, which is mainly used for the detection of drugs in urine at intensive care units (ICUs) or forensic laboratories, showed negative result for benzodiazepines. The concentrations of etizolam and its metabolites in urine were measured by the established high-performance liquid chromatographic method. The concentrations of M-III and M-V were 700 and 1,600 ng/mL, respectively. AccuSign BZO demonstrated higher specificity-than the other screening kits for the detection of etizolam and its metabolites in urine. Therefore, the types of drugs detected would be increased by combining Triage DOA with AccuSign BZO in ICUs or forensic laboratories.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21485120 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Furthermore, these impairments are partly associated with the elimination half-life (EH) of the substance from the body. The object of the present study was to examine the effects of etizolam and ethyl loflazepate, with EHs of 6 h and 122 h, respectively, on information processing in healthy subjects.<br/>\n        METHODS: Healthy people were administered etizolam and ethyl loflazepate acutely and subchronically (14 days). The auditory P300 event-related potential and the neuropsychological batteries described below were employed to assess the effects of drugs on cognition. The P300 event-related potential was recorded before and after drug treatments. The digit symbol test, trail making test, digit span test and verbal paired associates test were administered to examine mental slowing and memory functioning.<br/>\n        RESULTS: Acute administration of drugs caused prolongation in P300 latency and reduction in P300 amplitude. Etizolam caused a statistically significant prolongation in P300 latency compared to ethyl loflazepate. Furthermore, subchronic administration of etizolam, but not ethyl loflazepate, still caused a weak prolongation in P300 latency. In contrast, neuropsychological tests showed no difference.<br/>\n        CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that acute administration of ethyl loflazepate induces less effect on P300 latency than etizolam.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21047414 [PubMed]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Neurochemical research suggests that etizolam may have selectivity for the subpopulation of Y-aminobutyric acid type A receptors associated with anxiety (ie, alpha1, beta2, gamma2). This property, plus its characterization as a ligand with fewer of the adverse events typical of full agonists (impaired cognitive function, tolerance, and dependence), led to its selection for this study.<br/>\n        OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to test for the noninferiority of etizolam 0.5 mg BID versus placebo in affecting cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate anxiety disorder of recent onset (&lt;1 month). Anxiety measures and tolerability were also assessed.<br/>\n        METHODS: Patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years were eligible for enrollment. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 5 centers in Italy using a 2-treatment, 3-period crossover design. Patients were randomized to 3-week sequences of either etizolam-placebo-placebo or placebo-etizolam-etizolam. They were evaluated at 4 scheduled visits (screening and days 7, 14, and 21). Cognitive function was assessed using scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Span test (total forward and backward scores and the time required to perform the test). Anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for screening and to monitor adequacy of therapy. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse events were also recorded.<br/>\n        RESULTS: A total of 77 white patients were enrolled (mean age, 33.3 years [range, 22-60 years]; 62.3% female; mean weight, 65.2 kg). With a power of 0.80, the difference between the effects of etizolam and placebo on WAIS Digit Span performance was not significant for total score (0.102 [90% CI, -0.130 to 0.335]) or time required for completion (0.029 second [90% CI, -0.574 to 0.632]). Anxiety, as measured using the HAM-A and STAI instruments, did not differ significantly between groups. No significant differences were found between etizolam 0.5 mg BID and placebo for cardiovascular events, weight changes, or adverse events. Mild or moderate somnolence was reported by 7 of 77 patients (9.1% [3 patients while receiving etizolam and 4 patients while receiving etizolam and placebo]).<br/>\n        CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences between etizolam 0.5 mg BID and placebo were found for cognitive function or anxiety measures in these patients with anxiety.

We present a case of a child who accidentally took a single dose of ETZ, approximately the same as a therapeutic dose for adults, and who showed paradoxical excitation and muscle weakness. The case presented here suggests that pediatricians and emergency physicians should be aware of the possible adverse effects in children and therapeutic approaches in intoxication of ETZ and the necessity of further investigations on a specific therapeutic guideline for overdose management especially in children.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 17666930 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

A further aim of the work was to investigate the effects of different CDs on the morphology, loading, and release properties of the MPs prepared. For these purposes, ETZ alone, and ETZ/CD-PLGA loaded MPs were prepared by the W/O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation method. It was found that the release of ETZ in vitro was more prolonged over three days with a kinetic constant proportional to t(1/2). It was also demonstrated that the CDs in these MPs are able to modulate several properties such as morphology, drug loading, and release properties. In fact, marked differences in shape, surface, and encapsulation efficiencies were noted depending on the presence, hydrophilicity, and charge of the CD employed. The obtained results induce us to consider the present ETZ-containing formulations as new valuable tools for the treatment of different insomnia categories.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 17454433 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of etizolam, a thienodiazepine derivative, in combination with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as an acute treatment for TTH.<br/>\n        METHODS: The study design was a multi-center randomized control trial and included 144 patients. The diagnosis of TTH was based on the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders-1 and all patients were diagnosed with episodic tension-type headache (ETTH). Changes in the severity of headache and shoulder pain were graded using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after administration of drugs. Patients were randomized into NSAID alone (NSAID, mefenamic acid, 250 mg) group and NSAID (mefenamic acid, 250 mg) plus etizolam (0.5 mg) (NSAID-ET) group prior to treatment.<br/>\n        RESULTS: Although both groups showed a significant drop in VAS for headache and shoulder pain (p&lt;0.01), there was no overall significant difference between the NSAID-ET and NSAID groups.

The present study evaluated medical treatment with the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, etizolam, for the resolution of CSDH, and the factors indicating surgery or conservative therapy. Alternate patients were assigned to the etizolam group or control group without medical treatment. Patients in the etizolam group received 3.0 mg etizolam per day for 14 days. A total of 53 patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Univariate analysis of differences in demographic characteristics, clinical findings, and initial computed tomography (CT) findings, and multiple logistic regression analysis of the relationship between etizolam treatment and requirement for surgery using age, sex, low density of hematoma on CT, and paresis as confounders were performed. Etizolam treatment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.156, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.024-0.999, p = 0.049) was negatively correlated with requirement for surgery. Low density of hematoma (adjusted OR 0.125, 95% CI 0.019-0.846, p = 0.033) was found to be an independent negative predictor, and paresis as an initial symptom (adjusted OR 6.35, 95% CI 1.04-38.7, p = 0.045) was an independent positive predictor of requirement for surgery. Etizolam administration can promote the resolution of CSDH, especially at the stage of hygroma appearing as low density on CT.

Exposure of rat hippocampal neurons in culture to 10 microM etizolam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha5 and gamma2S receptor subunit mRNAs, whereas etizolam withdrawal was associated with a persistent reduction in gamma2S mRNA and an increase in alpha2 and alpha3 mRNAs. Neither chronic exposure to nor withdrawal of etizolam affected the acute modulatory effects of etizolam or lorazepam on GABA-evoked Cl- current. Treatment with 10 microM lorazepam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha1 and gamma2S subunit mRNAs and increased that of alpha3 mRNA, whereas lorazepam withdrawal was associated with persistence of the changes in alpha3 and gamma2S mRNAs and an increase in alpha2 and alpha4 mRNAs. Parallel changes in the abundance of alpha1 and alpha4 subunit proteins induced by chronic exposure to and withdrawal of lorazepam, but not etizolam, were detected by immunocytofluorescence analysis. Chronic lorazepam treatment resulted in a reversible reduction in the modulatory efficacy of this drug and conferred on flumazenil the ability to potentiate GABA-evoked Cl- current. The anticonvulsant action of etizolam was not altered in mice chronically treated with this drug, whereas lorazepam-treated animals became tolerant to the acute anticonvulsant effect of this benzodiazepine. These data suggest that etizolam is endowed with a reduced liability to induce tolerance and dependence compared with classical benzodiazepines.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 16107249 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

In in vitro experiment, KSS and TSS inhibited CYP3A activity comparable to grapefruit juice. However in in vivo experiments, oral administration of KSS did not influence the plasma concentration profile of etizolam. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of etizolam was significantly reduced when TSS was co-administered at 20 times amount of human daily dosage. Since the double of human daily dose of TSS did not suppress the absorption of etizolam, TSS would not influence the pharmacokinetics of etizolam at the usual clinical dosage. Since both KSS and TSS did not influence the metabolism of etizolam, the result of in vitro experiment would not reflect to that of in vivo experiment or in clinic.

Subjects were 18 Japanese outpatients concomitantly treated with fluvoxamine before or after monotherapy with etizolam. Plasma concentrations of etizolam were measured using a column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection.

He was admitted to a nearby hospital. Hypothyroidism had been noted two months before admission. Marked muscle rigidity and increased serum CK were observed. Since discontinuation of benzodiazepine has been known to rarely trigger a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), he was diagnosed as having NMS. After receiving dantrolene and bromocriptine, these symptoms temporarily improved but he again developed consciousness disturbance, and convulsive seizures associated with an elevated serum CK. He was transferred to our hospital. On admission, the CK level was normal at 168 IU/l, while free T4 was 0.6 ng/dl (normal range, 0.9-2.3) and TSH was 108.7 mU/ml (normal range, 0.2-4.2) in serum, indicating the presence of primary hypothyroidism. As an increase in thyroid hormone dosage improved the thyroid function to normal level, his disturbed consciousness and muscle rigidity gradually improved. Convulsive seizure and recurrence of NMS in a short interval are unusual in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In this patient, hypothyroidism may have contributed to the development of malignant syndrome through metabolic changes of the central dopaminergic system, and discontinuation of etizolam, a kind of benzodiazepine, may have triggered NMS, since there has not been reported that discontinuation of antidepressants including amitriptyline triggers NMS.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 12424963 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

In order to rationalize the therapeutic use of etizolam, its pharmacodynamics properties on GABAA receptors were investigated by a comparative study with other ligands on human recombinant GABAA as well as rat brain native receptors. Etizolam inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner [3H]flunitrazepam (CAS 1622-62-4) binding to rat cortical membranes, with an affinity of 4.5 nmol/l greater than that of alprazolam (CAS 28981-97-7) (7.9 nmol/l). Ethizolam enhanced GABA-induced Cl- currents in oocytes expressing human cloned GABAA receptors. With alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit combination, etizolam produced a 73% increase in GABA-induced currents with an EC50 of 92 nmol/l. At the same receptor type, alprazolam showed a higher degree of potentiation and potency (98%, EC50 56 nmol/l). At alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2S or alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit constructs, the effects of etizolam were similar to those of alprazolam. Flumazenil (CAS 78755-81-4) completely blocked both etizolam and alprazolam effects on GABA-induced currents. Etizolam, administered i.p., was uneffective in changing ex vivo t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]-TBPS) binding to rat cerebral cortex, whereas alprazolam and abecarnil (CAS 111841-85-1) significantly reduced this parameter. However, etizolam similarly to abecarnil and alprazolam, antagonized isoniazid-induced increase (61%) in [35S]-TBPS binding to rat cortical membranes. Further, etizolam inhibited in a dose-dependent manner basal acetylcholine release from both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and reversed foot-shock-induced increase of basal acetylcholine release to a control level. Altogether, these results suggest that etizolam may have a reduced intrinsic activity, at least at specific subpopulations of GABAA receptors. This property, together with the pharmacokinetic indication of a short-acting drug, may characterize etizolam as a ligand endowed with less side-effects typical of full agonits such as diazepam (CAS 439-14-5) and alprazolam. Finally, given its marked efficacy under conditions of GABAergic deficit, etizolam may represent a possible drug of choice with reduced liability to produce tolerance and dependence after long-term treatment of anxiety and stress syndromes.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 10083975 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The single-dose kinetic profile of etizolam suggested that absorption after oral dosage was reasonably rapid, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) being attained within 0.5-2 h in all subjects. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) averaged 3.4 h. Consistent with this, steady-state concentration were rapidly achieved and accumulation was extremely limited. Predicted average plasma concentrations (Cp) did not differ significantly from those actually measured at steady-state, suggesting that the kinetics of etizolam was linear, at least at therapeutic doses. The mean wash-out t1/2 was comparable to the elimination t1/2 of the single dose, which means that the drug probably has no effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes and other kinetic variables after repeated dosing. At steady state plasma concentrations of the main metabolite, alpha-hydroxyetizolam, were higher and disappeared more slowly (mean t1/2 8.2 h) than those of the parent compound. Taken with the fact that in animals the metabolite shows almost the same potency of pharmacological action as etizolam, this suggests that it may contribute significantly to the clinical effects of the parent compound. Based on the kinetic characteristics of the parent drug and its metabolite, etizolam can be regarded as a short-acting benzodiazepine, with elimination kinetics between those of short-intermediate derivatives and ultra-rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 2065698 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Etizolam was generally well tolerated and the few side-effects reported, mainly daytime drowsiness, were of mild to moderate severity.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 1981698 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

JWH-018 is a CB1 and CB2 agonist with a higher affinity than Δ(9)-THC. In order to investigate the neurobiological substrates of JWH-018 actions, we studied by microdialysis in freely moving rats the effect of JWH-018 on extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). JWH-018, at the dose of 0.25 mg/kg i.p., increased DA release in the NAc shell but not in the NAc core and mPFC. Lower (0.125 mg/kg) and higher doses (0.50 mg/kg) were ineffective. These effects were blocked by CB1 receptor antagonists (SR-141716A and AM 251) and were absent in mice lacking the CB1 receptor. Ex vivo whole cell patch clamp recordings from rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons showed that JWH-018 decreases GABAA-mediated post-synaptic currents in a dose-dependent fashion suggesting that the stimulation of DA release observed in vivo might result from disinhibition of DA neurons. In addition, on the \"tetrad\" paradigm for screening cannabinoid-like effects (i.e., hypothermia, analgesia, catalepsy, hypomotility), JWH-018, at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p., produced CB1 receptor-dependent behavioural effects in rats. Finally, under appropriate experimental conditions, rats (20 μg/kg/inf iv, FR3; nose-poking) and mice (30 μg/kg/inf iv, FR1; lever-pressing) self-administer intravenously JWH-018. In conclusion, JWH-018 shares with the active ingredient of Marijuana, Δ(9)-THC, CB1-dependent reinforcing and DA stimulant actions.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 26327678 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

In rodents JWH-018 reproduces typical effects of (-)-Δ(9)-THC or Dronabinol® (Δ(9)-THC) such as hypothermia, analgesia, hypolocomotion and akinesia, while its effects on sensorimotor functions are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acute administration of JWH-018 (0.01-6mg/kg i.p.) on sensorimotor functions in male CD-1 mice and to compare its effects with those caused by the administration of Δ(9)-THC (0.01-6mg/kg i.p.). A specific battery of behavioral tests were adopted to investigate effects of cannabinoid agonists on sensorimotor functions (visual, auditory, tactile) and neurological changes (convulsion, myoclonia, hyperreflexia) while video-tracking analysis was used to study spontaneous locomotion. JWH-018 administration inhibited sensorimotor responses at lower doses (0.01-0.1mg/kg), reduced spontaneous locomotion at intermediate/high doses (1-6mg/kg) and induced convulsions, myoclonia and hyperreflexia at high doses (6mg/kg). Similarly, administration of Δ(9)-THC reduced sensorimotor responses in mice but it did not inhibit spontaneous locomotion and it did not induce neurological alterations. All behavioral effects and neurological alterations were prevented by the administration of the selective CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM 251). For the first time these data demonstrate that JWH-018 impairs sensorimotor responses in mice. This aspect should be carefully evaluated to better understand the potential danger that JWH-018 may pose to public health, with particular reference to decreased performance in driving and hazardous works.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25987201 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

These compounds have the 1-naphthoyl-group attached at each of the possible substituent positions of the indole ring. The six compounds have the same elemental composition C24H23NO and the same substituents attached to the indole ring. The electron ionization mass spectra showed equivalent regioisomeric major fragment ions resulting from cleavage of the groups attached to the central indole nucleus. The characteristic (M-17)(+) fragment ion at m/z 324 resulting from the loss of an OH group was significant in the EI-MS of 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-(1-naphthoyl)-1-pentylindole. Fragment ions occurred at m/z 127 and 155 for the naphthyl and naphthoyl cations common to all six regioisomeric substances. Indole containing fragments produced the cations at m/z 284, 270, 214 and 186. The unique fragment at m/z 141 observed in the 1,2- and 1,7-isomers resulted from a rearrangement involving the two indole substituents to yield the C10H7CH2(+) cation. The major points of EI-MS differentiation of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 from the other five isomers are the high relative abundance of both the m/z 144 ion and the m/z 324 ion in the JWH-018 spectrum. GC separations on a capillary column containing a trifluoropropyl methyl polysiloxane (Rtx-200) stationary phase provided excellent resolution of these six compounds. The elution order appears related to the relative distance between the two indole substituents with the lowest retention associated with minimum distance between the groups attached to the indole nucleus. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25965306 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Although terminal fluorination of N-pentyl indole SCs is sometimes known to improve cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor binding affinity, little is known of the effects of fluorination on functional activity of SCs. This study explores the in vitro functional activities of SC designer drugs JWH-018, UR-144, PB-22, and APICA, and their respective terminally fluorinated analogues AM-2201, XLR-11, 5F-PB-22, and STS-135 at human CB1 and CB2 receptors using a FLIPR membrane potential assay. All compounds demonstrated agonist activity at CB1 (EC50 = 2.8-1959 nM) and CB2 (EC50 = 6.5-206 nM) receptors, with the fluorinated analogues generally showing increased CB1 receptor potency (∼2-5 times). Additionally, the cannabimimetic activities and relative potencies of JWH-018, AM-2201, UR-144, XLR-11, PB-22, 5F-PB-22, APICA, and STS-135 in vivo were evaluated in rats using biotelemetry.

In the last year, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reported to the Italian National Early Warning System the seizure of plant material containing new halogenated derivatives of JWH-018 (JWH-018 Cl and JWH-018 Br). The present study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo activity of these two new synthetic cannabinoids in mice. In vitro competition binding experiments performed on mouse and human CB1 receptors revealed a high affinity and potency of the halogenated compounds. Synthetic cannabinoids (0.01-6 mg/kg i.p.) impaired motor activity and induced catalepsy in mice and their effects were more severe with respect to those evoked by Δ(9)-THC. Moreover, they increased the mechanical and thermal pain threshold and induced a marked hypothermia. It is interesting to note that whereas high doses of JWH-018 cause seizures, myoclonia and hyperreflexia, the halogenated compounds, in particular JWH-018Br, were less effective. Behavioral and neurological changes were prevented by the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM 251. These data demonstrate for the first time that JWH-018 Cl and JWH-018 Br act similarly to JWH-018 while inducing less convulsive episodes and myoclonias. These data support the hypothesis that the halogenated compounds may have been introduced onto market to produce similar intoxicating effects as JWH-018 while causing less side effects.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25769232 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

To draw the right conclusions regarding new intake of these substances in situations of repeated urinary drug testing, knowledge of their elimination rate in urine is essential. We report data from consecutive urine specimens from five subjects after ingestion of synthetic cannabinoids. Urinary concentrations of the carboxylic acid metabolites JWH-018-COOH and JWH-073-COOH were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS) with a limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL. In these subjects, specimens remained positive over a period of 20-43 (mean 27) days for JWH-018-COOH and over a period of 11-25 (mean 19) days for JWH-073-COOH. Detection times were shorter for subjects that appeared to have ingested only one, or a few, doses prior to urine collection in the study. Creatinine-normalized concentrations (CN-concentrations) slowly declined throughout the follow-up period in all subjects, suggesting that no new intake had taken place during this period. Mean elimination half-lives in urine were 14.0 (range 4.4-23.8) days for CN-JWH-018-COOH and 9.3 (range 3.6-16.8) days for CN-JWH-073-COOH. These data show that urine specimens could be positive for JWH-018-COOH for more than 6 weeks and JWH-073-COOH for more than 3 weeks after ingestion. However, such long detection periods require a low limit of quantification. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25737323 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Compounds in this class are often collectively known as 'Spice'. After ingestion, these compounds are extensively metabolized to their hydroxy and carboxylic acid metabolites. During forensic analysis, detection of these metabolites in urine is an indication of past exposure to the parent compounds. The analytical process involved hydrolysis of conjugated metabolites by glucuronidase, solvent extraction, derivatization by trifluoroacetic anhydride and hexafluoroisopropanol and GC-EIMS detection. Identification of the unknown was based on the criteria of GC retention time within ±2% and mass spectral ion ratio within ±20% of that of a standard. Deuterated internal standards of the carboxylic acid metabolites were used for quantification. The acid (JWH-018-COOH, JWH-073-COOH) and hydroxy (JWH-018-OH, JWH-073-OH) metabolites were linear over the concentration range of 0.1-10 and 0.2-10 ng/mL, respectively, with a correlation coefficient-square, R(2) &gt; 0.999 (N = 5). Extraction recoveries of the metabolites were within 79 and 87%. The method was applied to 17 urine specimens collected as part of a military law enforcement investigation. Nine of the specimens tested positive for one or more of the metabolites. When the procedure was extended to screen other AAI compounds, two of the specimens were found to contain JWH-210, JWH-250 (JWH-302 or JWH-201) and JWH-250 (C4 isomers). The GC-EIMS method presented here was found to be suitable for detecting JWH-018 and JWH-073 metabolites and other AAI compounds in urine. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 25691387 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

JWH-018 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) was established as a discriminative stimulus and rimonabant was used to examine mechanisms responsible for discrimination as well as operant response rate-decreasing and hypothermic effects. JWH-018 dose-dependently increased drug-lever responding (ED50=0.01 mg/kg) and decreased response rate (ED50=0.064 mg/kg). Among various cannabinoids, the relative potency for producing discriminative stimulus and rate-decreasing effects was the same: CP-55940=JWH-018&gt;Δ9-THC=WIN-55212-2=JWH-073. The benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and the NMDA antagonist ketamine did not exert JWH-018 like discriminative stimulus effects up to doses that disrupted responding. JWH-018 and Δ9-THC decreased rectal temperature by 2.2 and 2.8°C, respectively; the doses decreasing temperature by 2°C were 0.21 and 1.14 mg/kg, respectively. Antagonism did not differ between JWH-018 and Δ9-THC, but did differ among effects. The apparent affinities of rimonabant calculated in the presence of JWH-018 and Δ9-THC were not different from each other for antagonism of discriminative stimulus effects (6.58 and 6.59, respectively) or hypothermic effects (7.08 and 7.19, respectively). Apparent affinity estimates are consistent with the same receptors mediating the discriminative stimulus and hypothermic effects of both JWH-018 and Δ9-THC. However, there was more limited and less orderly antagonism of rate-decreasing effects, suggesting that an additional receptor mechanism is involved in mediating the effects of cannabinoids on response rate. Overall, these results strongly suggest that JWH-018 and Δ9-THC act at the same receptors to produce several of their shared psychopharmacological effects.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24972243 [PubMed - in process]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The present study examined the effects of indole-derived cannabinoids in rats trained to discriminate Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) from vehicle. In addition, the effects of Δ(9)-THC in rats trained to discriminate JWH-018 from vehicle were assessed. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 3mg/kg Δ(9)-THC or 0.3mg/kg JWH-018 from vehicle. JWH-018, JWH-073, and JWH-210 fully substituted in Δ(9)-THC-trained rats and Δ(9)-THC substituted in JWH-018-trained rats. In contrast, JWH-320, an indole-derived cannabinoid without affinity for CB1 receptors, failed to substitute for Δ(9)-THC. Pre-treatment with 1mg/kg rimonabant significantly reduced responding on the JWH-018-associated lever in JWH-018-trained rats. These results support the conclusion that the interoceptive effects of Δ(9)-THC and synthetic indole-derived cannabinoids show a large degree of overlap, which is predictive of their use for their marijuana-like intoxicating properties. Characterization of the extent of pharmacological differences among structural classes of cannabinoids, and determination of their mechanisms remain important goals. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24887450 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

We used the cannabinoid tetrad and drug discrimination to compare in vivo effects of inhaled drugs with injected doses of these two SCBs, as well as with the phytocannabinoid Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC). Mice inhaled various doses of Δ(9)-THC, JWH-018 or JWH-073, or were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with these same compounds. Rectal temperature, tail flick latency in response to radiant heat, horizontal bar catalepsy, and suppression of locomotor activity were assessed in each animal. In separate studies, mice were trained to discriminate Δ(9)-THC (IP) from saline, and tests were performed with inhaled or injected doses of the SCBs. Both SCBs elicited Δ(9)-THC-like effects across both routes of administration, and effects following inhalation were attenuated by pretreatment with the CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant. No cataleptic effects were observed following inhalation, but all compounds induced catalepsy following injection. Injected JWH-018 and JWH-073 fully substituted for Δ(9)-THC, but substitution was partial (JWH-073) or required relatively higher doses (JWH-018) when drugs were inhaled. These studies demonstrate that the SCBs JWH-018 and JWH-073 elicit dose-dependent, CB1 receptor-mediated Δ(9)-THC-like effects in mice when delivered via inhalation or via injection. Across these routes of administration, differences in cataleptic effects and, perhaps, discriminative stimulus effects, may implicate the involvement of active metabolites of these compounds. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24857780 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Increasing reports of adverse reactions, including dependence and withdrawal, are appearing in the clinical literature. Here we investigated whether the effects of one such synthetic cannabinoid, 1-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole (JWH-018), would be altered by a prior history of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) exposure, in assays of conditioned taste aversion and conditioned place preference. In the conditioned taste aversion procedure, JWH-018 induced marked and persistent aversive effects in mice with no previous cannabinoid history, but the magnitude and duration of these aversive effects were significantly blunted in mice previously treated with an ascending dose regimen of Δ9-THC. Similarly, in the conditioned place preference procedure, JWH-018 induced dose-dependent aversive effects in mice with no previous drug history, but mice exposed to Δ9-THC before place conditioning showed reduced aversions at a high JWH-018 dose and apparent rewarding effects at a low dose of JWH-018. These findings suggest that a history of Δ9-THC exposure 'protects' against aversive effects and 'unmasks' appetitive effects of the high-efficacy synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 in mice. This pattern of results implies that cannabinoid-naive individuals administering K2/'Spice' products for the first-time may be at an increased risk for adverse reactions, whereas those with a history of marijuana use may be particularly sensitive to the reinforcing effects of high-efficacy cannabinoids present in these commercial smoking blends.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24625557 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The present study extends these findings by testing the hypothesis that CYP2C9- and 1A2-selective chemical inhibitors, sulfaphenazole (SFZ) and α-naphthoflavone (ANF), block oxidation of JWH-018 and AM2201 in human liver microsomes (HLM).

No metabolic inhibition was observed with omeprazole, quinidine, and ketoconazole. The results presented herein further demonstrate the importance of CYP2C9- and 1A2-mediated oxidation of JWH-018 and AM2201 and the likelihood of adverse toxicity in populations with polymorphic alleles of these enzymes. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24329780 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

However, few studies have been conducted on deposition of synthetic cannabinoids and metabolites in hair. The first purpose of this study was to establish and validate an analytical method for detection of JWH-018, JWH-073, and their metabolites in hair, by use of UHPLC-MS-MS, for forensic application. The second purpose was to investigate the distribution of synthetic cannabinoids metabolites in hair and the effect of hair pigmentation, by use of an animal model. For this, JWH-073 was chosen as a representative synthetic cannabinoid. Finally, the developed method was applied to hair samples from 18 individuals suspected of synthetic cannabinoids use. JWH-018, JWH-073, and their metabolites were extracted from hair with methanol. The extract was then filtered and analyzed by UHPLC-MS-MS with an electrospray ion source in positive-ionization mode. Validation proved the method was selective, sensitive, accurate, and precise, with acceptable linearity within the calibration ranges. No significant variations were observed when different sources of both human and rat hair were used. The animal study demonstrated that JWH-073 N-COOH M was the major metabolite of JWH-073 in rat hair, and hair pigmentation did not have a significant effect on incorporation of JWH-073 and its metabolites into hair. In the analysis of 18 authentic hair samples, only JWH-018, JWH-018 N-5-OH M, and JWH-073 were detected, with wide variation in concentrations. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 24162819 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Thus, elucidation of the metabolic pattern and the detection of the intake of these drugs have been of major concern. In order to suggest appropriate urinary biomarkers to prove JWH-018 or JWH-073 intake, we selected the major metabolites of JWH-018 and JWH-073, namely (ω)-, (ω-1)-hydroxy, carboxy and 6-hydroxyindole metabolites, and validated a method for the quantification of these metabolites using solid-phase extraction based on LC-MS/MS analysis. Authentic urine specimens obtained from drug offenders were screened via a synthetic cannabinoid ELISA kit and were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for confirmation. Twenty-one out of a total of 52 samples (40%) were found positive for at least one metabolite of JWH-018 or JWH-073. N-pentyl hydroxy metabolites of JWH-018 and carboxy metabolites of JWH-018 and JWH-073 were detected in all positive samples. However, the rest of the metabolites were either not detected or only a small amount of them were found. A considerable variation was observed in the concentration ratio of (ω) and (ω-1)-hydroxy metabolites of JWH-018. Based on the results, it may have some pitfalls to determine the ingestion of specific synthetic cannabinoids by detecting a few metabolites, considering the continuous emergence of structurally related synthetic cannabinoids. Thus, use of synthetic cannabinoids should be proven carefully through comprehensive investigation of analytical results of biological specimens. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 23890611 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Other than JWH-018 or JWH-073, AM-2201 is one of the frequently identified synthetic cannabinoids in Korea. Recently, in our laboratory, several JWH-018 metabolites have been detected in some urine samples obtained from subjects who were arrested for the possession of herbal mixtures containing only AM-2201 or from those who confessed AM-2201 abuse. In the present study, we identified major urinary metabolites of AM-2201 and several metabolites of JWH-018, i.e., N-5-hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites from rats administered AM-2201 and found that the metabolic profile in rats was similar to those in human subjects in this study. Analytical results of the urine samples from suspects who had a considerable possibility of AM-2201 or JWH-018 intake were also compared to distinguish between AM-2201 and JWH-018 abuse. The presence of 6-indole hydroxylated metabolites of each drug and N-4-hydroxy metabolite of AM-2201 was found to contribute to the decisive differences in the metabolic patterns of the two drugs. In addition, the concentration ratio of the N-(5-hydroxypentyl) metabolite to the N-(4-hydroxypentyl) metabolite of JWH-018 may be used as a criterion to differentiate between AM-2201 and JWH-018 abuse. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 23884698 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Because SCBs are frequently used in combinations, we hypothesized that coadministering multiple SCBs induces synergistic drug-drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions between JWH-018 and JWH-073 were investigated in vivo for Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)-like discriminative stimulus effects, analgesia, task disruption, and hypothermia. Combinations (JWH-018:JWH-073) of these drugs were administered to mice in assays of Δ(9)-THC discrimination, tail-immersion, and food-maintained responding, and rectal temperatures were measured. Synergism occurred in the Δ(9)-THC discrimination assay for two constant dose ratio combinations (1:3 and 1:1). A 1:1 and 2:3 dose ratio induced additivity and synergy, respectively, in the tail-immersion assay. Both 1:1 and 2:3 dose ratios were additive for hypothermia, whereas a 1:3 dose ratio induced subadditive suppression of food-maintained responding. In vitro drug-drug interactions were assessed using competition receptor-binding assays employing mouse brain homogenates and cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R)-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in Neuro2A wild-type cells. Interestingly, synergy occurred in the competition receptor-binding assay for two dose ratios (1:5 and 1:10), but not in the adenylyl cyclase activity assay (1:5). Altogether, these data indicate that drug-drug interactions between JWH-018 and JWH-073 are effect- and ratio-dependent and may increase the relative potency of marijuana substitutes for subjective Δ(9)-THC-like effects. Combinations may improve the therapeutic profile of cannabinoids, considering that analgesia but not hypothermia or task disruption was potentiated. Importantly, synergy in the competition receptor-binding assay suggests multiple CB1R-SCB binding sites. <br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 23801678 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Recent reports indicate that monohydroxylated metabolites of JWH-018 and JWH-073 retain high affinity and activity at cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs), potentially contributing to the enhanced toxicity of K2 compared to marijuana. Since the parent compounds also bind to cannabinoid type-2 receptors (CB2Rs), this study investigated the affinity and intrinsic activity of JWH-018, JWH-073 and several monohydroxylated metabolites at human CB2Rs (hCB2Rs). The affinity of cannabinoids for hCB2Rs was determined by competition binding studies employing CHO-hCB2 membranes. Intrinsic activity of compounds was assessed by G-protein activation and adenylyl cyclase (AC)-inhibition in CHO-hCB2 cells. JWH-073, JWH-018 and several of their human metabolites exhibit nanomolar affinity and act as potent agonists at hCB2Rs. Furthermore, a major omega hydroxyl metabolite of JWH-073 (JWH-073-M5) binds to CB2Rs with 10-fold less affinity than the parent molecule, but unexpectedly, is equipotent in regulating AC-activity when compared to the parent molecule. Finally, when compared to CP-55,940 and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), JWH-018, JWH-018-M5 and JWH-073-M5 require significantly less CB2R occupancy to produce similar levels of AC-inhibition, indicating that these compounds may more efficiently couple CB2Rs to AC than the well characterized cannabinoid agonists examined. These results indicate that JWH-018, JWH-073 and several major human metabolites of these compounds exhibit high affinity and demonstrate distinctive signaling properties at CB2Rs. Therefore, future studies examining pharmacological and toxicological properties of synthetic cannabinoids present in K2 products should consider potential actions of these drugs at both CB1 and CB2Rs.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 23537664 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

To address whether the behavioral effects of the synthetic compound JWH-018 are similar to those induced by classical cannabinoid agonists, we investigated, in outbred CD1 mice, the consequences of its acute and sub-chronic administration (0, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg, IP) at the level of body temperature, pain perception, general locomotion, and anxiety. In order to address whether the exposure to precocious stressors-modified individual reactivity to this psychoactive substance, we also investigated its effects in adult mice previously exposed to prenatal stress in the form of corticosterone supplementation in the maternal drinking water (33 or 100 mg/L). In the absence of major effects on motor coordination, JWH-018-reduced body temperature, locomotion and pain reactivity, and increased indices of anxiety. Prenatal corticosterone administration-reduced individual sensitivity to the effects of JWH-018 administration in all the aforementioned parameters.

The compound was identified as JWH-307, a synthetic cannabinoid of the phenyl-pyrrole subclass with known in vitro binding affinities for cannabinoid receptors. To date, this is the first appearance of this subclass of cannabimimetics in such products. JWH-307 has been further characterized by gas chromatography accurate mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS), electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy.

We developed and validated a rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of trace concentrations of two of these compounds, JWH-018 and JWH-073, in human blood. Samples underwent liquid-liquid extraction at pH 10.2 into ethyl ether. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed in positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring using two transitions and one calculated ion transition ratio for each analyte. Deuterated analogs were used as internal standards. Total run time was 2.6 min. The linear dynamic range was 0.05-50 ng/mL with a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL for each analyte. Intra-run imprecision (at two different concentration levels, 2 and 8 ng/mL) was 3.9-10.3% for JWH-018 and 3.5-6.2% for JWH-073. Inter-run imprecision was 6.5-7.2% for JWH-018 and 4.8-5.5% for JWH-073. Intra-run accuracy was 95.9-112.7% for JWH-018 and 92.6-104.7% for JWH-073.

Five C57BL6 mice were sacrificed 20 min after exposure to the smoke of 200 mg of \"Magic Gold\" and a second set of five exposed mice were sacrificed after 20 h. Twenty minutes after exposure to \"Magic Gold\" smoke, blood concentrations of JWH-018 ranged from 42 to 160 ng/mL (mean: 88 ng/mL ± 42) and those of JWH-073 ranged from 67 to 244 ng/mL (mean: 134 ng/mL ± 62).

Twenty hours after exposure to \"Magic Gold\" smoke, JWH-018 was detected and quantified in only two of the five blood samples. Blood concentrations of JWH-018 were 3.4 ng/mL and 9.4 ng/mL. JWH-073 was detected in only one blood specimen 20 h after exposure at 4.3 ng/mL. Brain concentrations 20 h post exposure for JWH-018 ranged from 7 to 32 ng/g (mean: 19 ng/g ± 9). JWH-073 was not detected in 20 h post exposure brain specimens. JWH-398 was not detected in any of the blood or brain samples. The disposition data presented with the limited data available from human experience provide reasonable expectations for forensic toxicologists in JWH-018 or JWH-073 cases. As with THC after smoking marijuana, blood and brain concentrations of JWH-018 and JWH-073 after HIP smoking can be expected to rise initially to readily detected values, and then drop dramatically over the next few hours to several ng/mL or ng/g, and finally to be at extremely low or undetectable concentrations by 24h apparently due to extensive biotransformation, and redistribution to body fat.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 22405481 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The indole-derived cannabinoids identified in these products were originally developed as research tools and are structurally distinct from cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. Although abused by humans, most published research on this class of compounds has been performed in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel series of 1-pentyl-3-phenylacetylindoles in mice.<br/>\n        METHODS: The potencies of these analogs to produce the cannabinoid agonist effects of antinociception, hypothermia and suppression of locomotion were evaluated in ICR mice. The major structural manipulations in the present series included the type of substituent (i.e., unsubstituted, methyl, methoxy, chloro, bromo, and fluoro) and the position of the substituent on the phenyl ring (i.e., 2-, 3- or 4-position).<br/>\n        RESULTS: Potencies of this series of phenylacetylindoles for each cannabinoid effect were highly correlated with CB(1) receptor affinities reported previously. Active compounds produced a profile of effects that resembled that exhibited by Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most critical factor affecting in vivo potency was the position of the substituent. Whereas compounds with 2- and 3-phenylacetyl substituents were efficacious with good potencies, 4-substituents resulted in compounds that had poor potency or were inactive.<br/>\n        CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that phenylacetylindoles with good CB(1) binding affinity share pharmacological properties with THC in mice; however, they also emphasize the complexity of molecular interactions of synthetic cannabinoids with CB(1) receptors and suggest that scheduling efforts based solely upon structural features should proceed with caution.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 22127210 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Here, the behavioral effects of JWH-018 and JWH-073 were examined in one behavioral assay selective for cannabinoid agonism, rhesus monkeys (n = 4) discriminating Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC; 0.1 mg/kg i.v.), and another assay sensitive to cannabinoid withdrawal, i.e., monkeys (n = 3) discriminating the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg i.v.) during chronic Δ⁹-THC (1 mg/kg s.c. 12 h) treatment. Δ⁹-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073 increased drug-lever responding in monkeys discriminating Δ⁹-THC; the ED₅₀ values were 0.044, 0.013, and 0.058 mg/kg, respectively and the duration of action was 4, 2, and 1 h, respectively. Rimonabant (0.32-3.2 mg/kg) produced surmountable antagonism of Δ⁹-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073. Schild analyses and single-dose apparent affinity estimates yielded apparent pA₂/pK(B) values of 6.65, 6.68, and 6.79 in the presence of Δ⁹-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073, respectively. In Δ⁹-THC-treated monkeys discriminating rimonabant, the training drug increased responding on the rimonabant lever; the ED₅₀ value of rimonabant was 0.20 mg/kg. Δ⁹-THC (1-10 mg/kg), JWH-018 (0.32-3.2 mg/kg), and JWH-073 (3.2-32 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the rimonabant-discriminative stimulus (i.e., withdrawal). These results suggest that Δ⁹-THC, JWH-018, and JWH-073 act through the same receptors to produce Δ⁹-THC-like subjective effects and attenuate Δ⁹-THC withdrawal. The relatively short duration of action of JWH-018 and JWH-073 might lead to more frequent use, which could strengthen habitual use by increasing the frequency of stimulus-outcome pairings. This coupled with the possible greater efficacy of JWH-018 at cannabinoid 1 receptors could be associated with greater dependence liability than Δ⁹-THC.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21965552 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The major active constituent of the drug is Δ⁹- tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC). Δ⁹-THC exerts its psychological activities by interacting with the cannabinoid receptors (CB₁ and CB₂) in the brain. JWH-018, HU-210, and CP-47497, with CB₁ agonist activity (similar to Δ⁹-THC), have been used by the drug culture to spike smokable herbal products to attain psychological effects similar to those obtained by smoking marijuana. The products spiked with these CB₁ agonists are commonly referred to as \"Spice\" or \"K2\". The most common compound used in these products is JWH-018 and related compounds (JWH-073 and JWH-250). Little work has been done on the detection of these synthetic cannabimimetic compounds in biological specimens. This report investigated the metabolism of JWH-018 by human liver microsomes, identification of the metabolites of JWH-018 in urine specimen of an individual who admitted use of the drug, and reports on the quantitation of three of its urinary metabolites, namely the 6-OH-, the N-alkyl OH (terminal hydroxyl)-, and the N-alkyl terminal carboxy metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Samples fortified with JWH-018-d₉ and JWH-073-d₉ underwent liquid-liquid extraction and were analyzed by liquid chromatography-positive ion electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Two transitions were monitored for all analytes except JWH-250, for which there was only one available transition. JWH-019 did not meet the stringent requirements for quantitative analysis, and thus this method is only appropriate for the qualitative identification of this compound in whole blood. The linear range was 0.1-20 μg/L for all quantitative analytes. The maximum average within and between-run imprecision was 7.9% and 10.2%, respectively, and all controls quantified within 8.2% of target concentrations. Process efficiency, a measurement that takes into effect extraction efficiency and matrix effect, was ≥ 32.0% for all quantitative analytes; similar results were obtained for the deuterated internal standards. All analytes were stable at room, refrigerated, and frozen temperatures for at least 30 days.

JWH-018, a prevalent K2 synthetic cannabinoid, is structurally distinct from Δ(9)-THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Since even subtle structural differences can lead to differential metabolism, formation of novel, biologically active metabolites may be responsible for the distinct effects associated with K2 use. The present study proposes that K2's high adverse effect occurrence is due, at least in part, to distinct JWH-018 metabolite activity at the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R).<br/>\n        METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: JWH-018, five potential monohydroxylated metabolites (M1-M5), and one carboxy metabolite (M6) were examined in mouse brain homogenates containing CB1Rs, first for CB1R affinity using a competition binding assay employing the cannabinoid receptor radioligand [(3)H]CP-55,940, and then for CB1R intrinsic efficacy using an [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay. JWH-018 and M1-M5 bound CB1Rs with high affinity, exhibiting K(i) values that were lower than or equivalent to Δ(9)-THC. These molecules also stimulated G-proteins with equal or greater efficacy relative to Δ(9)-THC, a CB1R partial agonist. Most importantly, JWH-018, M2, M3, and M5 produced full CB1R agonist levels of activation. CB1R-mediated activation was demonstrated by blockade with O-2050, a CB1R-selective neutral antagonist. Similar to Δ(9)-THC, JWH-018 and M1 produced a marked depression of locomotor activity and core body temperature in mice that were both blocked by the CB1R-preferring antagonist/inverse agonist AM251.<br/>\n        CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Unlike metabolites of most drugs, the studied JWH-018 monohydroxylated compounds, but not the carboxy metabolite, retain in vitro and in vivo activity at CB1Rs. These observations, combined with higher CB1R affinity and activity relative to Δ(9)-THC, may contribute to the greater prevalence of adverse effects observed with JWH-018-containing products relative to cannabis.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21755008 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Symptoms associated with K2 use include extreme agitation, syncope, tachycardia, and visual and auditory hallucinations. One major challenge to clinicians is the lack of clinical, pharmacological, and metabolic information for the detection and characterization of K2 and its metabolites in human samples. Information on the metabolic pathway of SCs is very limited. However, previous reports have shown the metabolites of these compounds are excreted primarily as glucuronic acid conjugates. Based on this information, this study evaluates nine human recombinant uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms and human liver and intestinal microsomes for their ability to glucuronidate hydroxylated metabolites of 1-naphthalenyl-1(1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methanone (JWH-018) and (1-butyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenyl-methanone (JWH-073), the two most common SCs found in K2 products. Conjugates were identified and characterized using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, whereas kinetic parameters were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-UV-visible methods. UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, and UGT2B7 were shown to be the major enzymes involved, showing relatively high affinity with K(m) ranging from 12 to 18 μM for some hydroxylated K2s. These UGTs also exhibited a high metabolic capacity for these compounds, which indicates that K2 metabolites may be rapidly glucuronidated and eliminated from the body. Studies of K2 metabolites will help future development and validation of a specific assay for K2 and its metabolites and will allow researchers to fully explore their pharmacological actions.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21746969 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Previous human metabolic studies have identified (ω)-hydroxyl and (ω)-carboxyl metabolites as biomarkers that are indicative of product use. However, other primary metabolites exhibiting similar chromatographic properties and mass spectra are also excreted in human urine. Analytical standards were used in this study to identify new primary metabolites as (ω-1)-hydroxyl derivatives of JWH-018 and JWH-073. The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedure, coupled with an automated solid-phase extraction procedure incorporating deuterium-labeled internal standards, provides rapid resolution of the (ω)- and (ω-1) metabolites with adequate sensitivity, precision, and accuracy for trace analysis in human urine. Results from four urine specimens collected after individuals reportedly self-administered either JWH-018 or a mixture of JWH-018 and JWH-073 showed the following: (1) all tested metabolites were excreted in high concentrations, (2) (ω)- and (ω-1)-hydroxyl metabolites were exclusively excreted as glucuronic acid conjugates, and (3) ∼5%-80% of the (ω)-carboxyl metabolites was excreted as glucuronic acid conjugates.

Since these studies were based on LC-MS/MS and/or GC-MS identification and characterisation of analytes, the explicit structural assignment of the metabolites was only of preliminary nature, if possible at all. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of five potential in vivo metabolites of JWH-018 derivatives featuring an alkylcarboxy (M1), a terminal alkylhydroxy (M2), a 5-indolehydroxy (M3), an N-dealkylated 5-indolehydroxy (M4) and a 2'-naphthylhydroxy (5) analogue, respectively, and their characterisation by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The collision-induced dissociation (CID) patterns of the protonated compounds were studied by high-resolution/high-accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS( n )) applying an LTQ Orbitrap with direct infusion and electrospray ionisation of target analytes. An unusual dissociation behaviour including a reversible ion-molecule reaction between a naphthalene cation (m/z 127) and water in the gas phase of the MS was shown to be responsible for nominal neutral losses of 10 u in the course of the CID pathway. LC-MS/MS-supported comparison of synthesised reference standards with an authentic urine sample using an API 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer identified the synthetic JWH-018 analogues M1-M4 as true in vivo metabolites, presuming a chromatographic separation of potentially present regioisomeric analogues. Existing doping control methods were expanded and validated according to international guidelines in order to allow for the detection of the carboxy and the alkylhydroxy metabolites, respectively, as urinary markers for the illegal intake of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018. Both metabolites were quantified in authentic doping control urine samples that had been suspicious of JWH-018 abuse after routine screening procedures, and a stable isotope-labelled (13)C(8)-(15)N-carboxy metabolite was synthesised for future analytical applications.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21455647 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Ostensibly branded \"herbal incense\", they have been intentionally adulterated with synthetic cannabinoids such as JWH-018 in order to confer on them cannabimimetic psychoactive properties while circumventing drug legislation. JWH-018 is a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist. Little is known about its pharmacology and toxicology in humans. This is the first research considering the effects of JWH-018 on a psychiatric population and exploring the relationship between JWH-018 and psychotic symptoms.<br/>\n        METHOD: This paper presents the results of semi-structured interviews regarding the use and effects of JWH-018 in 15 patients with serious mental illness in a New Zealand forensic and rehabilitative service.<br/>\n        RESULTS: All 15 subjects were familiar with a locally available JWH-018 containing product called \"Aroma\" and 86% reported having used it. They credited the product's potent psychoactivity, legality, ready availability and non-detection in drug testing as reasons for its popularity, with most reporting it had replaced cannabis as their drug of choice. Most patients had assumed the product was \"natural\" and \"safe\". Anxiety and psychotic symptoms were common after use, with 69% of users experiencing or exhibiting symptoms consistent with psychotic relapse after smoking JWH-018. Although psychological side effects were common, no one reported becoming physically unwell after using JWH-018. Three subjects described developing some tolerance to the product, but no one reported withdrawal symptoms.<br/>\n        CONCLUSION: It seems likely that JWH-018 can precipitate psychosis in vulnerable individuals. People with risk factors for psychosis should be counseled against using synthetic cannabinoids.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 21316162 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Due to their reported cannabis-like effects, many European countries have banned these substances. The World Anti-Doping Agency has also explicitly prohibited synthetic cannabinoids in elite sport in-competition. Since urine specimens have been the preferred doping control samples, the elucidation of the metabolic pathways of these substances is of particular importance to implement them in sports drug testing programmes. In a recent report, an in vitro phase-I metabolism study of JWH-018 was presented yielding mainly hydroxylated and N-dealkylated metabolites. Due to these findings, a urine sample of a healthy man declaring to have smoked a 'spice' product was screened for potential phase-I and -II metabolites by high-resolution/high-accuracy mass spectrometry in the present report. The majority of the phase-I metabolites observed in earlier in vitro studies of JWH-018 were detected in this urine specimen and furthermore most of their respective monoglucuronides. As no intact JWH-018 was detectable, the monohydroxylated metabolite being the most abundant one was chosen as a target analyte for sports drug testing purposes; a detection method was subsequently developed and validated in accordance to conventional screening protocols based on enzymatic hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The method was applied to approximately 7500 urine doping control samples yielding two JWH-018 findings and demonstrated its capability for a sensitive and selective identification of JWH-018 and its metabolites in human urine.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 20872894 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

The high pharmacological and addictive potency of JWH-018 highlights the importance of elucidating the metabolism of JWH-018, without which a meaningful insight into its pharmacokinetics and its toxicity would not be possible. In the present study, the cytochrome P450 phase I metabolites of JWH-018 were investigated, after in vitro incubation of the drug with human liver microsomes, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This revealed monohydroxylation of the naphthalene ring system, the indole moiety, and the alkyl side chain. In addition, observations were made of dihydroxylation of the naphthalene ring system, and the indole moiety, or as result of a combination of monohydroxylations of both the naphthalene ring system and the indole moiety or the alkyl side chain, or a combination of monohydroxylations of both the indole ring system and the alkyl side chain. There is also evidence of trihydroxylation at different locations of the hydroxyl groups in the molecule. Furthermore, dehydration of the alkyl side chain, in combination with both monohydroxylation and dihydroxylation as well as arene oxidation of the naphthalene ring system, combined with both monohydroxylation and dihydroxylation at different sites of oxidation were found. N-dealkylation also in combination with both monohydroxylation and dihydrodiol formation of the N-dealkylated metabolite was detected. Finally, a metabolite was found carboxylated at the alkyl side chain.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 20838779 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Due to the high affinity of these compounds to the cannabinoid receptors, their effective dose is lower than that of the marijuana products resulting in a low concentration of the excreted metabolites accompanied by a higher psychoactive potency. Up to now the in vivo metabolism of the cannabimimetic indoles seems to be insufficiently investigated and no data have been published on an assay of JWH-018 in urine. In this publication the urinary metabolites of JWH-018 are reported. Using gas and liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry two main monohydroxylated metabolites were identified in the forensic urine samples. Based on the differences in their electron ionization MS/MS spectra it is supposed that one is formed by hydroxylation of the indole ring whilst the other by hydroxylation of the N-alkyl chain. The main metabolites are almost completely glucuroconjugated, whereas minor ones (N-despentyl hydroxy-, carboxy-, dihydroxy-, and reduced di- and trihydroxy metabolites) were also present in the free fraction. The parent compound was not detected in urine.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 20430547 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

Dose-effect relationships for hypothermic effects were determined in order to confirm that SCBs JWH-018 and JWH-073 are higher efficacy agonists than ∆9-THC in mice. Separate groups of mice were treated with saline, sub-maximal hypothermic doses of JWH-018 or JWH-073 (3.0 mg/kg or 10.0 mg/kg, respectively) or a maximally hypothermic dose of 30.0 mg/kg ∆9-THC once per day for 5 consecutive days while core temperature and locomotor activity were monitored via biotelemetry. Repeated administration of all drugs resulted in tolerance to hypothermic effects, but not locomotor effects, and this tolerance was still evident 14 days after the last drug administration. Further studies treated mice with 30.0 mg/kg ∆9-THC once per day for 4 days, then tested with SCBs on day 5. Mice with a ∆9-THC history were cross-tolerant to both SCBs, and this cross-tolerance also persisted 14 days after testing. Select brain regions from chronically treated mice were examined for changes in CB1 receptor expression and function. Expression and function of hypothalamic CB1Rs were reduced in mice receiving chronic drugs, but cortical CB1R expression and function were not altered. Collectively, these data demonstrate that repeated ∆9-THC, JWH-018 and JWH-073 can induce long-lasting tolerance to some in vivo effects, which is likely mediated by region-specific downregulation and desensitization of CB1Rs.<br/>\n        </p><p>PMID: 26361728 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</p>\n    ", publication_date: nil},

One of the first waves of these compounds identified in clandestine samples was 1-n-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole, JWH-018. These totally synthetic molecules can be prepared in a number of regioisomeric forms.<br/>\n        METHODS: The electron ionization mass spectrometric (EI-MS) fragmentation of the 1-n-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole is compared to its inverse isomer 1-naphthoyl-3-n-pentylindole. These two substances are directly available from indole using identical precursor reagents and similar reaction conditions. Stable isotope deuterium labeling of the three major regions of the JWH-018 molecule allows confirmation of the structures of the major fragment ions. The spectra for the 1-n-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)-d5 -indole, 1-n-pentyl-3-(1-d7 -naphthoyl)indole and 1-d11 -n-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole provide significant assistance in elucidating the structures for the major fragment ions in JWH-018.<br/>\n        RESULTS: The EI mass spectra for these isomers show a number of unique ions which allow for the differentiation of the 1-alkyl-3-acylindole compounds from the inverse regioisomeric 1-acyl-3-alkylindoles. The fragment ion [M-17](+) at m/z 324 for JWH-018 was formed by the elimination of a hydroxyl radical and the spectra of the three deuterium-labeled derivatives indicated the loss of hydrogen from the naphthalene ring. Further structural analogues suggest the hydrogen to come from the 8-position of the naphthalene ring.<br/>\n        CONCLUSIONS: The three deuterium-labeled analogues provide significant assistance in confirming the structures for the major fragment ions in the mass spectrum of the traditional synthetic cannabinoid compound, 1-n-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole, JWH-018. The 1-naphthoyl-3-n-pentylindole inverse regioisomer can be easily differentiated from the traditional synthetic cannabinoid compound.
