  = kp "Cannabinoids are a group of substances that act on the brain's cannabinoid receptors. Types of cannabinoids include endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) produced by the body such as anandamide, phytocannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabidiol and cannabidiol which are found naturally occuring in plants, and synthetic cannabinoids such as marinol and JWH-018 which have been artificially designed and produced. Cannabinoid receptors identified in the brain and body of humans so far include CB1 and CB2, as well as numerous others for which only preliminary evidence exists. Recent years have seen an explosion in the number of synthetic cannabinoids appearing on the market for sale, as well as increased research into the role of cannabinoid receptors in the body and naturally occuring phytocannabinoids. Some sources of phytocannabinoids recently discovered are Tea (Camellia sinesis) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897346] and the Kava plant [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22525682]. The second-most plentiful cannabinoid in the Cannabis plant, Cannabidiol, has been found to have wakefulness promoting effects [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851090] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19045957], as well as antipsychotic [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16612464] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716160] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108553], anti-anxiety [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20945065] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307846] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20829306] and anti-depressant properties [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20002102] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332000]." Around 430 synthetic cannabinoids were discovered by John W. Huffman while working at Clemford University, many of which have been marketed as legal highs or research chemicals. On the subject he is quoted as saying "I figured once it got started in Germany it was going to spread. I'm concerned that it could hurt people," Huffman said. "I think this was something that was more or less inevitable. It bothers me that people are so stupid as to use this stuff".
