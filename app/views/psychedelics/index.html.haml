%h1 Psychedelics
= kp %Q/The word "Psychedelic" is derived from the Greek words ψυχή (psyche, "soul, mind") and δηλείν (delein, "to manifest"), hence "soul-manifesting", the implication being that psychedelics can access the soul and develop unused potentials of the human mind. The term encompasses a wide range of substances and is considered by many to be more accurate than the term "hallucinogens", as many of these drugs can produce altered states of consciousness without producing hallucinations in many people. The term "entheogenic" (meaning generating the divine within) is also used to describe these substances in situations where their use has a spiritual significance. An example would be the usage of Mescaline by the Kiowa people, DMT-based compounds by the Amazonians in the form of Ayahuasa, and Ibogaine by the Bwtists. For the purposes of classification here, two main classes may be defined, known as tryptamine and phenylethylamine derivatives. Researcher Alexander Shulgin first wrote about these and synthesized many of the initial substances we know of today, described in his books PiHKaL and TiHKAL (phenylethylamines I have known and loved and tryptamines I have known and loved, respectively)./
